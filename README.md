# Reciper
It's an android application that connects to edamam.com API and looks for meals according to user entry in search bar.

For now result is displayed in ListView.

## It doesn't work, why?

In order to make it work you have to get your own api key and app id from https://developer.edamam.com/

When you get them, replace api_key and app_id strings with your own id and key in JSONDownloader file

## TO DO: 

- Add another pages of results(now only first 10 are displayed in ListView)
- ~~Add photo of meal in the ListView~~
- Add visuals(GUI, icons, fonts)
- ?


Write me if you have any questions.
