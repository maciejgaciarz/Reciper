It's an android application that connects to edamam.com API and looks for meals according to user entry in search bar.

For now result is displayed in ListView.

TODO: 

- Add another pages of results(now only first 10 are displayed in ListView)
- Add photo of meal in the ListView
- Add visuals(GUI, icons, fonts)
